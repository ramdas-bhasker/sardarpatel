                                    serious scholarly composition objectified in its presentation. It must have a logical development, which evokes the researcher’s findings, using the techniques of observation and interpretation.</p>
                                <p>So, to be a good researcher, it is necessary to have a basic foundation on Research methods. The study of Research Methodology provides us the necessary training in choosing methods, materials, scientific tools and training
